# Changelog

## 0.4.0 — Specialists, and a Plans page

### Added

- **Specialists.** Before a task starts, FreeAgentCoder works out what kind of work it is and follows the method that suits it. **Debugging** reproduces the problem before fixing it and proves the fix with a test. **Refactoring** runs the tests before and after and changes no behaviour. **Interface design** matches the project's existing components and checks phone width. **Data and ML** fixes seeds, holds data out and reports a baseline. **Building** works end to end with nothing faked. **Explaining** answers from the code and changes nothing. Each has a finish line the agent must meet before reporting done, and a short request that is really one of these is given the time it needs. You'll see the method named at the top of the task.
- Specialists can be improved without a new release: once a day the extension checks the project's site for updated instructions. It is a plain request that sends nothing about you or your project, and **freeagentcoder.specialistUpdates** turns it off.
- **Plans**, in Settings and as **FreeAgentCoder: Plans**. It shows the free tier you are on — your own keys, and the providers that give one away with no card — and, only if one has been switched on, a paid tier for when your free limits run out, with its price, its weekly quota and a button to get a licence. The page asks the project's site for this only when you open it; the free tier still makes no calls of its own. Where paid requests would go is said plainly: through FreeAgentCoder's server, unlike the free tier.

- **Fyx: everyday tasks in seconds, with no tokens.** Zipping or unzipping a folder, git (status, pull, push, commit with your message, branches, clone, fork), installing or adding packages, running your project's dev server, build or tests (including a project one folder down), creating, moving and copying files, and counting lines or sizes are now done on your machine without an AI model. Zipping a project folder used to take minutes and thousands of tokens; Fyx does it in under a second, and leaves out node_modules and .git unless you ask. Every command still asks the usual permission. Fyx learns as you go: a short request the AI agent finished with a single command is done by Fyx the next time. Anything else goes to the agent as before. `freeagentcoder.fyx` turns it off.
- **Keys are checked with a real request when you add them.** A key whose account needs billing or an active plan is refused with the reason, instead of failing in the middle of a task.
- **A free trial, so the first task works with no key.** Until you add a key of your own, tasks run on a daily allowance on the project's keys: about two or three real tasks a day. Those requests go through FreeAgentCoder's server, and the panel says so when they do. Add your own free key and the trial steps aside; `freeagentcoder.freeTrial` turns it off.

### Changed

- **Cohere is a new free provider.** Its trial key needs no card and allows 1,000 calls a month at 20 a minute, on Command A+. Cohere does not allow trial keys for production or commercial work, and the extension says so where you add one. It is the last free provider tried, because the monthly allowance runs out quickly.
- **Simpler key setup: Gemini, Groq and OpenRouter.** These three give free keys that work straight away. Mistral and Cohere stay as optional extras, and Mistral's free plan is explained (it must be chosen, with a verified phone number). **Cerebras is removed**: its free keys stopped working.
- **Cerebras is no longer offered as a free provider anywhere.** Some places still described it as free after 0.3.1. It is now listed with the paid providers, is never tried in the free rotation, and keys you already saved keep working.

## 0.3.1 — Honest about Cerebras

### Fixed

- **Cerebras is no longer described as a free tier**, because it is not one any more. Their documentation now says there is no permanently free tier: it is $5 of credits that need a card and expire after 30 days. The extension said otherwise in several places, which meant following its advice led to a payment wall. The providers that still need no card are Gemini, Groq, Mistral and OpenRouter.

### Changed

- The one-time question about sending anonymous counts now comes after your **first** task rather than the third. Someone who tries it once and moves on is exactly who it is worth hearing from.
- **"Get a free key" buttons** now pass through a redirect on the project's site, which counts only the provider and the day, so it is possible to tell how many people reach the point of getting a key. The provider's own address is still shown beside the button as a direct link, and the redirect never blocks the way through.

## 0.3.0 — Work on tasks from Project Brain

### Added

- **Anonymous counts, if you say yes.** Asked once, after a few tasks, and off until then: how many keys you have and which providers, how many tasks ran and how they ended, and short causes such as `gemini:daily-limit`. Never code, prompts, file names or keys. The question is skipped entirely when VS Code's own telemetry is off, and **FreeAgentCoder: Anonymous Usage Data** shows exactly what would be sent, and turns it off again.
- **Screenshots are read on your computer.** A text reader runs locally and pulls the text out of a screenshot — an error, a stack trace, a terminal, a block of code — with no API request at all, so your free limits go to the coding instead. It downloads about 6 MB the first time and works offline after that. A vision model is asked only when an image holds little readable text, or when what matters is the layout rather than the words. Turn it off in **Settings → Overview**.
- Anything read locally is marked as such in the prompt, with a warning that a reader gets capitals, quotes and spacing wrong, so the agent looks names up in your project instead of trusting the spelling.
- **Project Brain handoff.** Plan a change on the Project Brain website, click **Work on this in VS Code**, and FreeAgentCoder opens with the plan written into the chat: the goal, the files involved, and the steps in order. Nothing runs until you read it and press Send, and every edit still follows your permission mode.
- The handoff checks the open folder: if it is not the repository the task was planned for, FreeAgentCoder says so before you send.
- Task links are validated before anything is shown: malformed links, unknown versions, oversized content and file paths outside the project are refused.

## 0.2.0 — Checked work, clear limits, easy to find

### Added

- **Right side bar.** FreeAgentCoder now opens in the right side bar, next to your code.
- **Get started guide.** Opens right after install and shows where FreeAgentCoder is, how to add keys and how to ask for a first task. Reopen it with **FreeAgentCoder: Get Started**.
- **Test my project.** Runs the project's own type check, lint, tests and build, and explains every failure in plain words with a fix. Also available as **FreeAgentCoder: Test My Project**.
- **Checked before done.** Complex tasks that change code must pass one of the project's own checks after their last edit before they can finish. Checks are detected for Node.js, Python, Flutter/Dart, Rust, Go, .NET and Java.
- **Project layout map** given to complex tasks at the start of a chat.
- **Health** in Settings: every job FreeAgentCoder routes to its own models, and each key and model's status, requests, failures, response time and last error.
- **Limit warnings before a task starts** when today's remaining limits look too small, with an Add a key button.
- **Savings** in Overview: what your free-key usage would have cost on a paid model.
- **Recommended key setup** with a direct, underlined link for each free provider, and a clear note to get one key per account.

### Changed

- Daily limits are recognized: the key is set aside until it resets, the next key takes over, and the task no longer waits pointlessly for a limit that resets hours later.
- A conversation too large for every model is summarized and the task continues.
- Errors show a plain-language title and next step, with technical details folded away. Key and limit problems appear as warnings, not failures.
- The chat panel opens faster: pdf.js is loaded only when a PDF is attached.
- New orange brand color throughout the chat panel, buttons, switches and icon.
- Adding a key: "Get a free Gemini key" (named for the selected provider) is a clear full-width button, a pasted key selects its provider automatically, and a Paste button reads the clipboard in one click.
- Marketplace description and keywords use the terms people search for, plus screenshots and a support link.

### Fixed

- The "Get a free key" and "Save key" buttons showed overlapping, cut-off text: updating a button's label replaced its icon instead.

## 0.1.1 — Easier to find

### Changed

- The Marketplace name is now "Free Agent Coder — Free AI Coding Agent", with a clearer description and keywords, so the extension turns up for searches like "free ai agent", "coding agent" or "free agent coder". The extension id and all commands are unchanged.

## 0.1.0 — First public release

### Added

- Chat panel with formatted Markdown replies, a live plan, grouped file exploration, inline diffs, live command output, approval cards and one-click undo.
- API key manager: named keys per provider, verified before saving and encrypted in VS Code Secret Storage, with test, rename, disable and remove.
- Automatic failover across keys and providers, with cooldowns for models that keep failing.
- Auto routing: fast models for quick tasks, the strongest models for complex work, or pin any model.
- Usage for each key (today, this window, last 30 days) and provider-reported quota with low-quota warnings.
- Project stack detection, Python and ML guidance, and Jupyter notebooks read as clean cells.
- Manual, Auto-edit and Auto permission modes.
- Senior mode for complex builds: an environment check, stack playbooks (Flutter, web, Node.js API, Python backend, machine learning), required quality checks and a quality report.
- Always asks before system-wide installs, global packages, or changes to shell profiles and PATH.
- A warning when a complex task falls back to a weak model, and each key's last error in Settings.
- Chat history, saved on your computer only after you say yes. Reopen, search and delete past chats from the new History button.
- Automatic recovery: when every model is rate-limited or the connection drops, the task waits and resumes by itself instead of stopping.
- Instant local code search: a `search_code` tool, plus the most relevant files attached to complex tasks. No API calls, no quota used.
- "Limits across your keys": provider-reported limits added up across all your keys, with suggestions on when and which keys to add.
- A local error log in Settings → Logs, with what was fixed automatically, and Copy diagnostics with keys and personal paths removed.
- Redesigned Settings with tabs and a clearer settings icon.
- Attachments: paste, drop or attach screenshots, PDFs (including scanned), Word, PowerPoint, Excel and long text. A vision model reads images and scanned pages first; very long documents are summarized and saved for the agent to read.
- Correction mode: "Point out a fix" under each reply, or describe what's wrong. Each point is fixed with the smallest change and verified separately.
- Memory: lessons learned from your corrections (or "remember that …") are followed in future tasks, and can be reviewed, added or deleted in Settings → Memory.
- Overview: prompts left today from provider-reported limits, project status, 7-day efficiency and on/off switches for every feature.
- Clearer notices that API keys stay on your device, encrypted in VS Code Secret Storage.
